#Briefing
This repository is initially created for my possible TA workload. It relates to our familiar commandline tool curl[1] as well as its library -- libcurl[2]. If luckily someone else is viewing this page(or is forced to view it, e.g. you have enrolled Prof. U's course), please be noticed that I am also learning cURL from the scratches. Let's hope we can have fun in it.
